## Gousto Product Search and Filtering App

### How to use this app

#### Installation

You can run this app from any computer by following these steps: 

1. Install a browser add-on to disable CORS blocking. The following are recommended: 
  -Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi)
  -Firefox: 
  https://addons.mozilla.org/en-Gb/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/
  -Safari: 
  Select 'Disable Cross-Origin restrictions from the 'Develop' menu. (If the 'Develop' menu isn't there, it can be enabled under 'Advanced' in Preferences)

2. Clone the source from the repository by entering the following commands in the terminal: 
```
git clone https://github.com/giancarlo88/gousto-app
cd gousto app
npm install && npm start
```

#### Using the app

The app will download a list of filters and products upon loading the page.

To filter products from a specific category, click that category name. Only items containing that category will be displayed. Simply click the category name again to turn the filter off. 

To search for a specific product, type a part of its name in the search box. It will filter results whose title or description contains that text. To show all the products again, delete the text in the field. 

Clicking on a product title will show a brief description of the product. You can show as many descriptions at a time as you like. If you want to hide the description of a product, click the product title again. 

#### How this solution works

This App has components whose roles are separated into logic and presentation. 

Due to the simple nature of the app, most of the logic surrounding App state is dictated in views/ProductSearch, whose state servers as a simple model and whose methods collectively serve as a controller. 

This component manages the following functions: 

  1. Triggering functions to call the API as it's mounting, storing the results in state if the call is successful, and triggering a UI response if there's an error. 
  2. Passing down filter data to the Filters container, and passing down product data to the Products container. 
  3. Handling changes to the currently selected filter by updating the store and passing this information both the Filters and Products containers whenever it changes.
  4. Handling changes to the input field by updating the store and passing this information to the Products container whenever it changes. 

The two containers have the role of receiving props and rendering components based on those props. Both map out components conditionally.

The containers/ProductFilters component will always render all the filters given passed to it by the filters prop. It has the currently selected filter passed down as the selectedFilter prop, and will conditionally set the isSelected prop on a certain filter to true if that filter's title matches the isSelected prop. Finally, it passes the handleFilterClick function to each Filterâ€”-the returned function is passed the title of the filter as an argument. This allows the state of the parent component to be set as the title of that filter. 

The containers/ProductList component has a similar function though it is slightly more complex. The component maps through the products it receives as a prop and maps each out based on a few conditions:

  1. If there is query passed down as a prop, the product should render if the query is contained in either the title or the description. This is done simply using the native indexOf() function.
  2. If there is a selectedFilter passed down as a prop, the product should render if one of its categories matches the selectedFilter. This is again acheived with indexOf(). Note that a simple array of the product categories is generated with a simple function, which is extracted out so it can be reused elsewhere.

If a product is rendered, it is passed the title and description. 

Finally, there are components which are meant to simply display information based on the props they receive. Therefore they are all stateless, with the exception of components/Product. This has a state which dictates whether or not to show the description. Because multiple descriptions can be shown at once, it's much simpler to handle the state of showing/hiding descriptions at this level rather than in a parent container.
